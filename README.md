## Installation

The Nielsen App SDK as of version 6.0.0.0 is compatible with Apple iOS version 8.0 and above.

Segment-Nielsen SDK is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Segment-Nielsen-DCR"
```

The integration relies on the the Nielsen framework, which can either be installed via Cocoapods or by manually adding the framework. You will need to have a Nielsen representative to get started.

## Cocoapods

When using the Nielsen SDK version 6.2.0.0 and above, Nielsen recommends installation via Cocoapods, and Apple recommends using the dynamic framework.

Installation of the Dynamic Nielsen App Framework SDK via Cocoapods requires a Cocoapods version 1.6.1 or higher. Installation of the Static Nielsen App Framework SDK via Cocoapods requires a Cocoapods version 1.4.0 or higher.

1. **Set your repository credentials.** The first step is to add the credentials received from Nielsen into your `.netrc` file. Navigate to your home folder and create a file called `.netrc`
```
cd ~/
vi .netrc
```
You will need to fill out a license agreement form and have the contact information for your Nielsen representative in order to obtain the credentials [here](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/Special:Downloads). Add the credentials in the following format:
```
machine raw.githubusercontent.com
login <Nielsen App SDK client>
password <Auth token>
```

2. **Add the source to your Podfile**

  Dynamic Framework (Note: you will need to include `use_frameworks!`)
```
source 'https://github.com/NielsenDigitalSDK/nielsenappsdk-ios-specs-dynamic.git'
```
Static Framework
```
source 'https://github.com/NielsenDigitalSDK/nielsenappsdk-ios-specs.git'
```

3. **Add the pod to your Podfile**
